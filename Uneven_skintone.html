<h1>Beauty Bar: Package 4 </h1>
    <p>
    Thanks for using Beauty Bar! Given your responses to the questions we've asked, you have been recommended Package 4: Uneven Skin Tone. 
    <br>
    Uneven skin tone, or hyperpigmentation, refers to the irregular darkening of skin. There are many causes of hyperpigmentation that range from the environment to hormones-- let's discuss them so that you can best understand why Beauty Bar recommended the products below for you. Firstly, exposure to UV light from the sun causes the skin to produce additional melanin so that it can provide an additional barrier. This extra melanin leads to dark spots and uneven skin tone. Next, as pollutants from the atmosphere penetrate the skin, it leads to the formation of darker skin spots. Lastly, acne tends to contribute to this hyperpigmentation as scars generally remain on the skin's surface even once the acne itself dies away. Hyperpigmentation takes time to treat, so you must be patient! Exfoliating is key so that you can ensure that dead skin cells are being removed and providing room for new skin celles to generate.

    Below is the list of organic products you can use to treat acne scarring. From left to right: Tumeric Powder, Oatmeal, Honey, Baking Soda, Papaya
