<h1>Beauty Bar: Package 1 </h1>
    <p>
    Thanks for using Beauty Bar! Given your responses to the questions we've asked, you have been recommended Package 1, Acne. 
    <br>
    Puberty is the main cause of acne. As hormone levels rise, skin glands begin to produce more oil (sebum), and as  oil mixes with dead cells and clogs your pores, bacteria forms under the skin. Yikes!! Bacteria! We know that no one likes bacteria and Beauty Bar is here to tell you that your skin absolutely detests it. As one of the main causes of acne-- bacteria is found in the environment, your hands, your pillow case-- any and everywhere! So, we'd caution you against touching your face with unwashed hands and going to bedwithout washing your face. Oftentimes the oils from your face gets locked in your pillow case and as your face contacts your pillow case, it is exposed to plenty of bacteria. So in addition to washing your face before bedtime, we also recommend changing your pillow cases often. 
    <br>
    Below is the list of organic products you can use to treat and prevent wrinkles. From left to right: Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil, Black Soap, Geranium Essential Oil, Tea Tree Essential Oil, and Witch Hazel.
