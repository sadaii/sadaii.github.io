<h1>Beauty Bar: Package 5 </h1>
    <p>
    Thanks for using Beauty Bar! Given your responses to the questions we've asked, you have been recommended Package 5: Enlarged Pores. 
    <br>
    Enlarged pores are typically a matter of genetics, but other causes include oily skin, aging, and clogged pores. While you may feel inclined to cover up your pores with makeup, Beauty Bar highly cautions against that as makeup with only exasterbate the issue-- clogging your pores even more. Further, cosmetics are generally magnets for dirt and oil which will cause your pores to shine even more where shining, in this case, is not a good thing. To prevent and treat enlarged pores, toning is key. This is why Beauty Bar has recommended the products below for you to simply apply to your face with a cotton pad.
    <br>
    Below is the list of organic products you can use to treat acne scarring. From left to right: Ice, Apple Cider Vinegar, Cucumber Juice, and Plain Yogurt
