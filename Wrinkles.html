<h1>Beauty Bar: Package 2 </h1>
    <p>
    Thanks for using Beauty Bar! Given your responses to the questions we've asked, you have been recommended Package 2: Wrinkles. 
    <br>
    There are various causes of fine lines and wrinkles, ranging from environmental factors to the natural aging process.However, the main reason for wrinkles is the breakdown of skin elasticity and collagen production. Therefore, you'll need products that will repair and regerate skin cells while also fighting skin-damaging free radicals caused by the environment's athmosphere. So, along with the recommended products, we recommend you add bananas, almonds, and ginger to your diet. Bananas are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that combat the causes of wrinkles and fine lines. Almonds are an excellent source of fiber, Vitamin E, iron, zinc, calcium, folic acid, and oleic acid, which combined can delay the aging process and treat wrinkes. Lastly, ginger has a high antioxidant content which helps to inhibit the breakdown of elastin, one of main causes of wrinkes as mentioned earlier.
